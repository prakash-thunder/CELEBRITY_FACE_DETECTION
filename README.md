### Below data science concepts are used in this project

  - Data loading and cleaning
  
  - Gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning
  
  - K fold cross validation

### Technology and tools used in this project

   - Python
   
   - CV2 for image Visualization and resize the image 
   
   -Numpy for convert 3D(rgb channel) to 1D
   
   - Sklearn for model building
   
   - Jupyter Notebook
   
   - Python flask for http server
   
   - HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
## Step
 1.We will first build a model using sklearn and SVC algorithm
 
 2.Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
 
 3.Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to select file of celebrity 
    
    Step#1: Import the required libraries
    Step#2: Load the data
    Step#3: convert 3D(rgb)array to 1D array
    Step#4: Build Machine Learning Model
    Step#5: Testing The model
    Step#6: Export the model
    Step#7: Export any other important info
## Frontend
- HTML
